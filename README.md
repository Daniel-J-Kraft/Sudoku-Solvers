# Sudoku-Solvers
I hate playing sudoku. This is an attempt to solve sudoku in as many ways as possible so I never have to do it again. We analyze the robustness and computational complexity of each approach to determine the most effective way to solve a sudoku puzzle. Current methods include: Backtracking, Convex L1-Norm Minimization, Re-weighted L1-Norm Minimization.#
